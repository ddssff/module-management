Unsupported:

   CPP directives.  It is difficult to see how this could be implemented.

Bugs:

   If you have a standalone derived instance of a type alias, it won't
   notice that the constructors of the original type are required.  E.g.:

     import Some.Module (Bar(..))
     type Foo Bar
     deriving instance Show Foo

   With this input, cleanImports will remove the "(..)" from the Bar import
   and the resulting file will not compile.  "deriving instance Show bar"
   will work correctly.

To Do:

   Don't expand tabs in output files
