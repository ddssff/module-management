Unsupported:

   CPP directives.  It is difficult to see how this could be implemented.

Bugs:

  1. If you have a standalone derived instance of a type alias, it won't
     notice that the constructors of the original type are required.  E.g.:

       import Some.Module (Bar(..))
       type Foo Bar
       deriving instance Show Foo

     With this input, cleanImports will remove the "(..)" from the Bar import
     and the resulting file will not compile.  "deriving instance Show bar"
     will work correctly.

  2. Leaves behind some .imports files

To Do:

  1. Don't expand tabs in output files
