This package has a successor: https://github.com/ddssff/refact-global-hse

Fork of <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/module-management>
improving hmm & knowledge of more fixities (Data.Lens). Dependency
on template-haskell is definitely not to be taken seriously.


Unsupported:

   CPP directives.  It is difficult to see how this could be implemented.

Bugs:

  1. If you have a standalone derived instance of a type alias, it won't
     notice that the constructors of the original type are required.  E.g.:

       import Some.Module (Bar(..))
       type Foo Bar
       deriving instance Show Foo

     With this input, cleanImports will remove the "(..)" from the Bar import
     and the resulting file will not compile.  "deriving instance Show Bar"
     will work correctly.

  2. Leaves behind some .imports files

  3. Template haskell will occasionally mess it up

  4. When it modifies an export list, all comments get stripped out.

  5. When it modifies an export list, some export symbols get re-ordered.

Bugs in CLI.hs:

  0. with haskeline sometimes there is no newline added before the
     prompt

  1. split Main.hs when file Main exists leads to crashes
     (fixed?)

  2. UI: split could take the module name too

  3. completion might be extended to accept regex / wildcards

  4. don't quit when something goes wrong, it should be possible to
     start over with what the previous settings were (dir and verse)
     (slightly done now?)

  5. options for: skip files that don't parse?

  6. \EOT doesn't work

  7. move cabal-file related items into library

To Do:

  1. Make sure original file is left as backup, not some intermediate.
     Or eliminate backup files, you should really run this on files
     under version control.
  2. Global cleanups: eliminate exports that are never imported
  3. Global cleanups: eliminate declarations that are not exported.
  4. Move nested declarations to the top level, adding arguments as
     necessary.  Also, move top level declarations into a nested position
     if they are only used in one place, removing arguments if possible.
  5. Show how to do a completely self contained split, writing source,
     splitting, reading back in and parsing.
