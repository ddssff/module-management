Unsupported:

   CPP directives.  It is difficult to see how this could be implemented.

Bugs:

  1. If you have a standalone derived instance of a type alias, it won't
     notice that the constructors of the original type are required.  E.g.:

       import Some.Module (Bar(..))
       type Foo Bar
       deriving instance Show Foo

     With this input, cleanImports will remove the "(..)" from the Bar import
     and the resulting file will not compile.  "deriving instance Show bar"
     will work correctly.

  2. If the symbols used by a standalone derived instance are imported by an
     import line with no specs, cleanImports with fail.  Add explicit imports
     by hand before running cleanImports.

  3. Leaves behind some .imports files

  4. Template haskell will frequently mess it up

To Do:

  1. Make sure original file is left as backup, not some intermediate
  2. Add a mode where no import cleanup is done after a split or cat

Questions:

  1. Does GHC omit Prelude imports even when NoImplicitPrelude option is given?
