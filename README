Unsupported:

   CPP directives.  It is difficult to see how this could be implemented.

Bugs:

  1. If you have a standalone derived instance of a type alias, it won't
     notice that the constructors of the original type are required.  E.g.:

       import Some.Module (Bar(..))
       type Foo Bar
       deriving instance Show Foo

     With this input, cleanImports will remove the "(..)" from the Bar import
     and the resulting file will not compile.  "deriving instance Show bar"
     will work correctly.

  2. Leaves behind some .imports files

  3. Template haskell will occasionally mess it up

  4. When it modifies an export list, all comments get stripped out.

  5. When it modifies an export list, some export symbols get re-ordered.

To Do:

  1. Make sure original file is left as backup, not some intermediate.
     Or eliminate backup files, you should really run this on files
     under version control.
  2. Do global check whether exported symbols are imported anywhere,
     and if not make them private.
